Inheritance makes my code more efficient and concise. I don't have to rewrite methods for classes that are similar but slightly different. Reading documentation helped a lot to understand Hashtables. At first I was struggling to work out the right words to use to alter the Hashtable, and to find certain values. But through carefully reading documentation and experimentation I worked it out.
